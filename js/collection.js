        "The Miami Memory Machine was inspired by my experiences of adolescence in Miami. Growing up, I felt like I didn’t see those stories reflected on TV or on film, but I resonated with memories of friends and family who were also from the city. I gathered their stories alongside my own, and converted them into video “memories.” The Machine is activated by a hot drink–like a cup of coffee–connecting with the microcontroller, and every sip you take triggers another memory. In this way, you too can reminisce over a life in Miami. ",

I quickly realized that there was a lack of data to back that theory. My research was first focused on augmented reality for learning. At the beginning of 2022, I pivoted to more general research on augmented reality for storytelling to first address the gap which is a lack of design standardization for creating augmented reality storybook experiences. The AR Storybook Guide is meant to aid designers, developers, 3D artists, and anyone else who is interested in creating AR storybooks. ",

It is a safe, intimate, healthy, and problem-solving-oriented space for parents and teenagers to share their family problems and get professional help and inspiration. I hope to assist more Chinese families in overcoming their preconceptions about counseling and better resolving their issues with more professional advice, thereby promoting a more harmonious parent-child relationship.",

Being diagnosed with cancer was already pretty bad. However, how people reacted and the weird things I heard during this period made the entire experience even worse. Thus, I want to talk about cancer stigma, especially when you are a young adult with cancer, because it comes with additional challenges. \n\nMy project consists of a 3D web experience that invites users to explore cancer narratives by clicking on different objects distributed in a peculiar architecture. Each object represents stories from young adults who had or have cancer. The use of objects and animated gifs aim to destigmatize the concept of being sick by normalizing living with cancer and adding humor to the stories.",

        "Starting out with the aim to improve online learning experiences, I realized that there is a need for more collaborative learning. I enjoyed solving digital electronics problems with my classmates during my college years, and that inspired me to design this game. In this game design, the players are stuck inside an old computer that they must fix to be able to get out. Each level is a digital circuits problem that the players must solve together by connecting the correct logic gates to the empty nodes, collecting gates as they go. The target demographic is undergraduate students in ECE or CS courses.",
