<h3>About IDM</h3>

<p><a href="https://idm.engineering.nyu.edu">The Integrated Design &amp; Media Program</a> (previously known as the Integrated Digital Media program) is a place that fosters creative practice, design research and multidisciplinary experimentation with emerging media technologies. IDM is a ‘STEAM‘ program combining artistic inquiry with scientific research and technological practice to explore the social, cultural and ethical potentials of emerging technologies. We focus on how to create new experiences with technologies but also on what is worth making and why.</p>

<p>In our academic programs, digital media is explored as a spectrum of practices that range from computer programming (for app development, software engineering, game development and interaction design) to 2D and 3D graphics (for human-computer interfaces, augmented reality, motion capture, and game design &amp; development) to photography, film, and audio (for media installations, performing arts research, and integration with various mediums). Our students are artists, designers, and creative technologists working in highly fluid industries that reward the creative, the thoughtful, the technical, and the innovative.</p>
